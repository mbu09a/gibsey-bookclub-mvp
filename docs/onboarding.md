# Welcome to **Gibsey β**

Gibsey is a *living edition* of **_The Entrance Way_**.

### How the gift loop works

1.  **Read** — browse 100‑word pages.  
2.  **Ask** — pose any question; Gibsey responds with cited quotes.  
3.  **Earn** — each helpful question or annotation = **+1 credit**.  
4.  **Give back** — spend credits on deeper analyses; save passages to your Vault.  
5.  **Share** — the ledger is public; value flows sideways, not up.

> “Receive curiosity as a gift; offer insight in return.”

Enjoy exploring, and thank you for keeping the loop alive!
