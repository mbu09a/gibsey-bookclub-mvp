# Gibsey Sprint 2 Progress

## Completed

1. **CDC Setup** (Deliverable 1) ‚úÖ 
   - Implemented Cassandra CDC with Debezium connector
   - Created Kafka topics for change events
   - Added comprehensive test and diagnostic scripts
   - Fixed Python 3.11 compatibility issues with Faust by using confluent-kafka

2. **Stargate Gateway** (Deliverable 2) ‚úÖ
   - Configured Stargate gateway in docker-compose.cdc.yml
   - Connected Stargate to Cassandra
   - Verified REST API functionality

## In Progress

3. **Kafka Consumer** (replacing Faust Worker - Deliverable 3) üü°
   - Created simple_consumer.py as a Python 3.11 compatible alternative
   - Implemented pattern-based topic subscription
   - Added robust error handling and reconnection logic
   - TODO: Implement embedding generation and vector storage in Cassandra

## Remaining

4. **Memory RAG Service** (Deliverable 4) ‚¨úÔ∏è
   - Create FastAPI service to manage embeddings
   - Implement FAISS index for efficient vector search
   - Add interface for page retrieval by semantic query

5. **Character Chat API** (Deliverable 5) ‚¨úÔ∏è
   - Create SSE stream for chat interactions
   - Implement character-specific responses
   - Connect to credit/debit system

6. **Nightly DAG** (Deliverable 6) ‚¨úÔ∏è
   - Set up Airflow for scheduled jobs
   - Create daily summary generation
   - Implement cluster analysis

7. **Smoke Tests** (Deliverable 7) ‚¨úÔ∏è
   - Create CI tests for latency and retrieval accuracy
   - Implement test harness

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Kafka Consumer/Embedding Worker**
   - Add embedding generation using Ollama
   - Implement Cassandra vector storage
   - Connect to FAISS index

2. **Start Memory RAG Service**
   - Create FastAPI service skeleton
   - Implement vector search functionality
   - Connect to Stargate API

## Notes on Implementation Changes

We had to make some adjustments to the original plan due to compatibility issues:

1. **Faust vs confluent-kafka**: Python 3.11 dropped the `loop` parameter in asyncio that Faust depends on, so we implemented a simpler Kafka consumer using confluent-kafka directly.

2. **Cassandra Connector Class**: Updated to use `Cassandra4Connector` instead of `CassandraConnector` for compatibility with Cassandra 4.x.

3. **Mock Connector Alternative**: Added a mock connector configuration for testing the pipeline when the Cassandra connector has issues.

The CDC pipeline is now operational and can be used as the foundation for the remaining deliverables.
